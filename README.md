# ChessEngineRepo

  This is my first big project. Don't blame me for some maybe common mistakes or bad architecture of repo in one day I'm gonna be better(maybe I hope atleast). 
  Yeah I had some troubles in gitignore so my first commit not pretty good. Idea of the engine is just to make some functions that counting the rating of all move in chess and make the best. 
  I hope you enjoy it:)
